ARCHIVED STILL WORKING AS OF 9/28/2023


Hello! This is my webhook tool made fully by Cafes. Here is all its features.
--------

Webhook Spammer:

This feature allows you to send multiple messages to a Discord webhook URL.
You can enter a Discord webhook URL and a list of messages to be sent.
The messages will be sent in random order with a specified delay between each message.
You can stop the spamming by pressing the 'V' key.

--------

Webhook Info:

This feature provides information about a Discord webhook URL.
You can enter a Discord webhook URL, and the code will retrieve and display information such as ID, type, name, URL, channel ID, guild ID, and token associated with the webhook.

--------

Webhook Deleter:

This feature allows you to delete a Discord webhook URL.
You need to enter the Discord webhook URL you want to delete, and the code will send a DELETE request to the webhook URL, removing it.
These features are useful for various purposes, such as testing and managing Discord webhooks. The code provides an interactive command-line interface where you can select the desired option, enter the necessary details, and perform the respective action.

--------

Bot Invite Link Generator:

This is a very simple tool where you give a bots user id and it will give you a invite link for the bot with the administator permissions selected for you already.

--------

Overall, this code provides a versatile set of tools to interact with Discord webhooks, allowing you to send messages, retrieve information, delete webhooks, and make bot invites.
